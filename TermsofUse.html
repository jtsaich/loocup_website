                18.<strong>Arbitration and Governing Law.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                . The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the
                Service shall be <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of
                arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether
                you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class
                arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
        a. By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so,       <strong>YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT</strong> to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken
                to small-claims court). <strong>YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.</strong> Your rights will be
                determined by a <strong>NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can
                grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details
                on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                b. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced
                in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against
                the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby
                irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                c. This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of
                conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
            </p>

                19.<strong>Indemnity by You.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its and their officers,
                agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any third party due
                to or arising out of your breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties contained
                herein), any postings or Content you post in the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation by you. The Company reserves the right to assume
                the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the Company
                in connection therewith.
            </p>
            <p>
                20.<strong>Notice.</strong> The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, using any reasonable means
                now known or hereafter developed, including by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message or postings in the Service. Such notices may not be received
                if you violate this Agreement by accessing the Service in an unauthorized manner. You agree that you are deemed to have received any and all notices
                that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service in an authorized manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                21.<strong>Entire Agreement; Other.</strong> This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any specific guidelines or rules that are separately posted
                for particular services or offers in the Service, contains the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the use of the Service. If any
                provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Company to
                exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your online
                account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your profile or contents within your account terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership,
                joint venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind the Company in any manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                22.<strong>Amendment.</strong> This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time.
